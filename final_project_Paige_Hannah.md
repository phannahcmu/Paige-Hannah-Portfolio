# **Final Project**: Credit scores are holding back future small business owners

# Part I for 09/27/21

## Overview of topic selection
One of the policy areas I'm most passionate about is financial inclusion - in other words, making sure that everyone has equitable access to affordable financial tools and resources. Credit scores are a critical gatekeeping mechanism that enables some people to have access to lots of safe financial tools at low cost. However, credit scores are also used to keep many people from accessing these tools - especially potential small business owners. With this presentation, my goal is for my audience to develop an understanding of (American) credit scores, why they are inequitable, the importance of small business owners being able to access capital, and actionable next steps to improve the situation. This is an incredibly important topic that I do not believe gets enough airtime and can benefit from data visualization to make the topic more accessible to all Americans.

I also wanted to share a bit more context about what lead me to consider this as my topic for the final project. This past summer, I interned at the Rockefeller Foundation as part of the Equity and Economic Opportunity team. The team's overarching goal was to decrease the racial wealth gap by improving acccess to capital for Black and Latinx business owners. One of the underlying assumptions of the team members was that since lending gatekeeping mechanisms like credit scores disporportionately negatively affect Black and Latinx individuals, credit scores should be not considered (or minimally considered) when banks and other organizations make loan decisions. I recently shared some of these insights with another class this mini, and I realized that the story behind WHY credit scores are racist and don't belong in loan decisions is not widely known. Therefore, I decided to make it the subject of my final presentation.


## Outline
I. **Introduction** - The goal of this section is for the audience to develop an understanding of what credit scores are, why they are important, and the thesis of the presentation: that credit scores should no longer be used for determing whether individuals should receive small business loans.

- Introduce credit scores - explain what they are, what they are used for, and what affects people's credit scores
- Many Americans do not have good credit scores or are "credit invisible"
- People of color are disproportionately hurt by the status quo
- How credit scores affect individuals' abilities to get small business loans
- This presentation will focus on how it affects your ability to start or expand a small business, and argues that credit scores should no longer be used for determining whether individuals should receive small business loans

II. **Analysis** - The goal of this section is for the audience to consider how important small businesses are to the nation's economy, and how factors unrelated to business success pull down credit scores (and therefore reduce an individual's ability to get loans to start and expand businesses).

- Minorities are disproportionately disadvantaged by credit scores, and they also own a disproportionately small number of businesses
- This has real-world impacts on the U.S. economy
- People have low credit scores for many reasons that are unrelated to their ability to run a successful business and their ability to repay their loans
- Ex: student loan payments
- Ex: medical bills
- Ex: credit card bills

III. **Recommendation** - The goal of this section is to provide a clear alternative option to using credit scores for small business loan decisions.
- Base loan decisions off an analysis of business viability

IV. **Conclusion** - The goal of this section is to give the call to action - I want the audience to immediate start educating their networks and supporting worthwhile organizations addressing this issue.
- The status quo is failing individuals and our country. You can make a difference!
- Here are the next steps you should take: spread the word (educate yourself, your family, your friends, and your community)
- Support organizations helping change the status quo

## The data
I have recreated the datasets that I will be using in [this Excel document](/Data for final project.xlsx).

Telling this particular story about credit scores requires a variety of data from different sources. Each tab in the Excel document represents a different visualization and includes the data needed to create the visualization, along withe the source(s). All of the data is publicly available.

I followed a specific process when finding the data I needed for the visualizations. First, I began by storyboarding - I developed the narrative and identified which types of data would be needed. For instance, in the introduction, I knew that I wanted to look into credit score components, credit score breakdowns by different categories of Americans (such as generation and race), and other important baseline information about credit scores that would be important for the audience to know.

Next, I spent time doing extensive research and data exploration to understand the story and make sure the data reflected what I expected. There were a few types of sources that I found most helpful: credit score companies or experts (e.g., Experian, Capital One), census data and other consumer data collected by the government, and relevant news articles highlighting specific topics (such as the number of uninsured Americans or student loan debt).

Overall, I am satisfied with the data I was able to find and I am confident that I will be able to create the visualizations I sketched in the previous section. Most of the data was pulled directly out of articles and tables from the various sources, and some basic calculations were completed to make the Census data usable (e.g., accounting for the Latinx population by cross referencing statistics on race and ethnicity). The data was fairly easily obtained and luckily does not require cleaning and interpretting large spreadsheets.


## Method & medium
I plan on using Shorthand to create my final project. There are several benefits to me using Shorthand for this project. First, Shorthand will lend itself well to storytelling, only requiring audiences to scroll down, not click through several pages. This will allow the audience to clearly follow the thread of the story. Second, Shorthand fills the function of both presentation and detailed report. During the presentation, I will be able to scroll through the narrative and pause on different visualizations, without overwhelming or distracting the audience. However, it also allows for paragraphs of information to be built out, so if someone is reading through the project, they are able to receive enough detailed analysis. Third, Shorthand allows for easy integration of visualizations (including interactive and animated visualizations). Finally, Shorthand is a new tool for me, so I am excited to develop a new skillset.

I will use Flourish and Tableau to create the visualizations themselves. Based on the exercises completed with the homeworks and in class, I believe that both tools will allow me to create the visualizations that I sketched, and enable me to make tweaks to color and other design choices to make the visualizations as effective as possible. I do not foresee using any other tools when creating my final project.

# Part II for 10/04/21

## Wireframes & storyboards
I chose to wireframe my charts by hand, and I chose to use Shorthand for my storyboard, which can be found here: <https://preview.shorthand.com/OCJ2M6J0xSM4oqlQ>.

I had already wireframed my stories by hand for final project part I, which was due last week. Therefore, my first step for part II was to work on my storyboard. Using my original outline for part I and feedback from my classmates last Tuesday, I began to put together my storyboard. The first step of my storyboarding process was to take a piece of notebook paper and write out the key ideas I wanted to convey to the audience. I had 7 or 8 bullets that made up the "frames" of my storyboard, from "here is what goes into credit scores" to "the borrowing gap affects anyone who cares about the U.S. economy." I rearranged the bullets into a cohesive storyline and removed anything that felt like too much unnecessary content.

Next, I created a Shorthand draft for my storyboard. I spent some time looking for relevant photos from Unsplash that would enhance my story. Using the photos and key ideas, I drafted a rough storyboard of my presentation in Shorthand. Finally, I added wireframes of the charts that were most important and best supported the story. I made some aesthetic tweaks to the presentation and experimented with the settings to get to know Shorthand better, since this is my first time using the platform. Once my storyboard was complete and the wireframes were added, I moved to the user research and interviews phase.


## User research & interviews
I began the user research phase by building out my user research protocol. I entered into the interviews with two main goals I hoped to accomplish: (1) exploring whether the flow of the story works and is convincing to the audience, and (2) testing whether there is too much detail, too little detail, or the right amount of detail throughout the presentation. This is a topic where it would be very easy to go down a rabbit hole by spending too much time on the details, or gloss over concepts that I assumed the audience understands but they actually need defined. Therefore, goal #2 was most important to me during this phase.

I went into this phase with the target audience of "anyone who is affected by the U.S. economy." I expected that the audience will be average Americans (or people living in America) with an average understanding of the credit score and financial system. Therefore, I chose three different audience members. The first interview was with a woman in her 50s with an above average understanding of the financial system. The second interview was with a man in his 50s, with an above average understanding of the financial system, and also works in data analytics so spends time thinking about how to use data to improve existing systems. The third interview was with a man in his 30s who is not a U.S. citizen but does have a strong understanding of financial systems in general. Both the second and third interviewee have started their own businesses. By selecting these three interviewees, I hoped to understand how the story resonated with people with different backgrounds.


**Here is the list of questions I used for my interview script:**
1. Is the presentation easy to understand? Are there any parts that are unclear, confusing, or could use more of an explanation?
2. Do I go into too much detail anywhere? Is there anything that should be removed?
3. Is the presentation aesthetically pleasing?
4. Are the charts helpful? Do they support the story, or do they seem off topic or distracting?
5. Are there any other changes you would make? Any other suggestions?


**Here are the findings from my interviews:**

Question | Person 1 | Person 2 | Person 3
-------- | -------- | -------- | --------
1) Clarity of presentation | It was all very clear | Nothing unclear | Overall, the presentation looked good and was very clear
2) Degree of detail | Would suggest cutting down on the intro - the preamble should be shorter which should also shorten the presentation | This is a great amount of detail - it forced me to think deeper about the issue. It is the right amount of detail for the average person audience member, but if you decided to have banks be your target audience, different pieces of your argument would need to be worked out in more detail | It was the right amount of detail. Would suggest simplifying some graphics to remove extra info that isn't needed
3) Presentation aesthetics | Yes, it is very aesthetically pleasing | Yes! | Really liked the website - very nice format
4) Charts add to story | Chart 2 (shows gradient of good, fine, and bad credit scores) should be removed. Not sure that chart 3 (breakdown of credit scores by generation) is necessary. Interesting but not needed | For chart 5, the left hand version of the visual should be used. Chart 3 should not be included - at first glance it actually tells the opposite story that you want it to (on average, people have good credit, not focused on all those who do not). Pie charts in chart 4 are much better | All of the charts add to the presentation. When asked specifically about chart 2, thought it could be distracting if I don't speak to it in the presentation, thinks I should leave it for audience members doing a detailed read-through
5) Other suggestions | The audience should be the average person (not banks), but important to spread awareness to people directly affected by this problem (those who want to start a business) | The audience should definitely be people who want to start small businesses - they need to know what they're up against (and maybe where to go for better resources). Could take this presentation a different direction for bank executives, but not the current version. | One suggestion in the "what are credit scores" section - remove "like" to make the presentation less informal.


**Similarities and differences across interviews:**
Overall, my three interviewees provided fairly consistent feedback. They felt the presentation was clear and generally the right level of detail, though I received some feedback on places where I could cut back on the number of charts or simplify the charts I included. My interviewees had different opinions about which charts should be removed, but I think I will err on the side of removing more and simplifying more, keeping my average person audience member in mind. They also all found the Shorthand presentation to be aesthetically pleasing, which was great to hear.

My presentation also sparked a really good discussion with some of my interviewees - they were interested in digging into the issue of credit scores and wanted to discuss solutions and the current state in more detail. Some great ideas were raised that gave me ideas about where to take future presentations (as it would be too much detail for the purposes of this presentation). I took this as a very good sign - it answered the question I raised in goal #1, whether the flow works and is convincing to the audience. It was convincing, and the audience wanted to take the discussion even further. I also felt that I was able to meet goal #2; my interviewees helped me identify places where I could use less detail, but overall they thought that the level of detail was appropriate.

Based on the feedback I received on my storyboard and wireframes, I am planning on implementing a number of changes to my visualizations and storyboard next week. There are a few categories of changes that I am planning on making:
1. **Removing some content:** I am going to shorten my introduction to streamline it more. I will remove chart #3, but include both pie charts for chart #4. I received conflicting advice about chart #2, so I still need to decide whether to keep it or remove it. My plan is to make the final version of this chart in Flourish or Tableau and then decide if it works in the flow of the story.
2. **Simplifying some content:** I will include just the simpler version of chart #5, and if I choose to include chart #2, I will simplify this as well.
3. **Refine my audience and call to action**: Based on feedback from my interviews, I will refine my audience to not be just the average person, but the average person who might be interested in starting a business. Additionally, this will require a slight change to the call to action - instead of supporting organizations working to change the status quo, I will instead direct them to work directly with these organizations, using them as a resource when starting or expanding their business.

I look forward to implementing these changes next week, finishing my write-up and including my sources, and creating the final versions of the charts for the final version of my presentation.
