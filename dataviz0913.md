## Part 2: Working with Flourish, grid of line charts
Brief description: This grid of line charts is used to convey information about OECD countries' debt-to-income ratios. In this style of chart, each of the countries is shown individually, though they are clustered together for comparison.

## Part 3: Working with Flourish, line chart
Brief description: The line chart style is also used to convey information about OECD countries' debt-to-income ratios. However, in this style of chart, all of the countries' data are stacked on top of each other. This allows for viewing general trends and calling out specific countries.

## Summary
All three styles of charts tell the audience different stories, though they use the same data. The first visualization shows a single point in time, which is relevant for an audience that is only interested in one year's data. The second visualization, a grid of line charts created using Flourish, gives additional information. Instead of showing point-in-time data for 2019 only (in a bar chart form, as is shown in part 1), this visualization uses a line graph form to show changes over time. The benefit of this visualization is that it allows for easy comparison between countries over several decades. It also allows the audience to easily spot outliers - i.e., those countries that experienced a significant increase in their ratios, such as the U.S. It conveys a greater depth of information, though direct comparisons between countries for a specific year is challenging in this format. This form is more useful for discussing changes over time, while the part 1 visualization has a more limited use case.

Ultimately, I chose the third visualization, the line chart, to display this data. There are a few key benefits to showing all of the countries' data stacked on top of each other. First, this format does allow the audience to see general trends over time for OECD countries (which tells a coherent story), but it does not require the audience to digest 35 separate line charts. (However, if the author wanted the audience to think about each individual country, the second visualization would be better.) Second, this format lets the author highlight different countries. Here, I wanted the audience to focus on four countries that experienced increasing ratios, so I made their lines red while making the other lines pastel so they would not stand out. These two key benefits to storytelling led me to choose visualization #3, a line chart.
