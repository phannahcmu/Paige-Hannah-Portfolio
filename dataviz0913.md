## Part 2: Working with Flourish, line chart
The following visualization was created using Flourish. Instead of showing point-in-time data for 2019 only (in a bar chart form, as is shown in part 1), this visualization uses a line graph form to show changes over time. The benefit of this visualization is that it allows for easy comparison between countries over several decades. It also allows the audience to easily spot outliers - i.e., those countries that experienced a significant increase or decrease in their ratios, such as the U.S. It conveys a greater depth of information, though direct comparisons between countries for a specific year is challenging in this format. This form is more useful for discussing changes over time, while the part 1 visualization has a more limited use case.

Ultimately, I chose the XXX chart to display this data.
