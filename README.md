# About me
My name is Paige Hannah (she/her) and I am a second year MSPPM graduate student (Master of Science in Public Policy and Management). I grew up in Pittsburgh, and I am excited to be back for grad school. Before coming to Heinz, I lived in D.C. for undergrad and the first three years after college. I earned my undergraduate degree from Georgetown University, where I majored in Finance and International Political Economy and Business and minored in French. While at Georgetown, I focused my time outside classes working for the Hilltop Microfinance Initiative, a student-run nonprofit that serves low-income entrepreneurs in the Washington, D.C. metro area.

After graduating from Georgetown, I worked as a Senior Business Analyst at McKinsey & Company's Washington, D.C. office. I focused on serving public and social sector clients (such as federal agencies, state governments, and large foundations), and I specialized in strategy and organizational health projects. I came to Heinz to deepen my policy knowledge and analytics expertise. I'm excited to use my MSPPM degree to pivot to the social sector and address the policy topics I'm most passionate about: financial inclusion, women's empowerment, racial equity, and economic equity.

This summer, I interned at the Rockefeller Foundation. I worked as a Summer Associate on the Equity & Economic Opportunity (EEO) team, where I supported the Foundation's goal of reducing the racial wealth gap in the U.S. by increasing access to capital for Black and Latinx business owners. After my final year at Heinz, I would like to work in the economic equity space, but I do not yet know exactly what types of roles I will be pursuing or the city I will live in.

## What I hope to learn
I hope to learn as much as I can about data visualization this semester. I signed up for this course because it is the epitome of what I wanted to learn at Heinz: how to use data to inform public policy and drive positive change in the world. I am already comfortable with basic graphs, charts, and data visualizations that can be conducted in Microsoft Office. I also took a beginner R class last year, where I learned basic coding, markdown, and some data visualizations. However, I am excited to expand my data visualization abilities in two key ways.

First, I am excited to learn how to use more tools. I am eager to learn more about GitHub and basic website creation, learn how to use Shorthand as an alternative to PowerPoint, and develop a basic working knowledge of Tableau. Second, I am excited to strengthen my ability to effectively communicate with an audience using data. This includes strengthening my storytelling abilities, learning new ways to display data, and other strategies for effective communication.
