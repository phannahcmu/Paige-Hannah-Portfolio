# **Final Project**: Credit scores are holding back future small business owners

# Part II for 10/05/21

## Wireframes & storyboards
I chose to wireframe my charts by hand, and I chose to use Shorthand for my storyboard, which can be found here: <https://preview.shorthand.com/OCJ2M6J0xSM4oqlQ>.

I had already wireframed my stories by hand for final project part I, which was due last week. Therefore, my first step for part II was to work on my storyboard. Using my original outline for part I and feedback from my classmates last Tuesday, I began to put together my storyboard. The first step of my storyboarding process was to take a piece of notebook paper and write out the key ideas I wanted to convey to the audience. I had 7 or 8 bullets that made up the "frames" of my storyboard, from "here is what goes into credit scores" to "the borrowing gap affects anyone who cares about the U.S. economy." I rearranged the bullets into a cohesive storyline and removed anything that felt like too much unnecessary content.

Next, I created a Shorthand draft for my storyboard. I spent some time looking for relevant photos from Unsplash that would enhance my story. Using the photos and key ideas, I drafted a rough storyboard of my presentation in Shorthand. Finally, I added wireframes of the charts that were most important and best supported the story. I made some aesthetic tweaks to the presentation and experimented with the settings to get to know Shorthand better, since this is my first time using the platform. Once my storyboard was complete and the wireframes were added, I moved to the user research and interviews phase.


## User research & interviews
I began the user research phase by building out my user research protocol. I entered into the interviews with two main goals I hoped to accomplish: (1) exploring whether the flow of the story works and is convincing to the audience, and (2) testing whether there is too much detail, too little detail, or the right amount of detail throughout the presentation. This is a topic where it would be very easy to go down a rabbit hole by spending too much time on the details, or gloss over concepts that I assumed the audience understands but they actually need defined. Therefore, goal #2 was most important to me during this phase.

I went into this phase with the target audience of "anyone who is affected by the U.S. economy." I expected that the audience will be average Americans (or people living in America) with an average understanding of the credit score and financial system. Therefore, I chose three different audience members. The first interview was with a woman in her 50s with an above average understanding of the financial system. The second interview was with a man in his 50s, with an above average understanding of the financial system, and also works in data analytics so spends time thinking about how to use data to improve existing systems. The third interview was with a man in his 30s who is not a U.S. citizen but does have a strong understanding of financial systems in general. Both the second and third interviewee have started their own businesses. By selecting these three interviewees, I hoped to understand how the story resonated with people with different backgrounds.


**Here is the list of questions I used for my interview script:**
1. Is the presentation easy to understand? Are there any parts that are unclear, confusing, or could use more of an explanation?
2. Do I go into too much detail anywhere? Is there anything that should be removed?
3. Is the presentation aesthetically pleasing?
4. Are the charts helpful? Do they support the story, or do they seem off topic or distracting?
5. Are there any other changes you would make? Any other suggestions?


**Here are the findings from my interviews:**

Question | Person 1 | Person 2 | Person 3
-------- | -------- | -------- | --------
1) Clarity of presentation | It was all very clear | Nothing unclear | Overall, the presentation looked good and was very clear
2) Degree of detail | Would suggest cutting down on the intro - the preamble should be shorter which should also shorten the presentation | This is a great amount of detail - it forced me to think deeper about the issue. It is the right amount of detail for the average person audience member, but if you decided to have banks be your target audience, different pieces of your argument would need to be worked out in more detail | It was the right amount of detail. Would suggest simplifying some graphics to remove extra info that isn't needed
3) Presentation aesthetics | Yes, it is very aesthetically pleasing | Yes! | Really liked the website - very nice format
4) Charts add to story | Chart 2 (shows gradient of good, fine, and bad credit scores) should be removed. Not sure that chart 3 (breakdown of credit scores by generation) is necessary. Interesting but not needed | For chart 5, the left hand version of the visual should be used. Chart 3 should not be included - at first glance it actually tells the opposite story that you want it to (on average, people have good credit, not focused on all those who do not). Pie charts in chart 4 are much better | All of the charts add to the presentation. When asked specifically about chart 2, thought it could be distracting if I don't speak to it in the presentation, thinks I should leave it for audience members doing a detailed read-through
5) Other suggestions | The audience should be the average person (not banks), but important to spread awareness to people directly affected by this problem (those who want to start a business) | The audience should definitely be people who want to start small businesses - they need to know what they're up against (and maybe where to go for better resources). Could take this presentation a different direction for bank executives, but not the current version. | One suggestion in the "what are credit scores" section - remove "like" to make the presentation less informal.


**Similarities and differences across interviews:**
Overall, my three interviewees provided fairly consistent feedback. They felt the presentation was clear and generally the right level of detail, though I received some feedback on places where I could cut back on the number of charts or simplify the charts I included. My interviewees had different opinions about which charts should be removed, but I think I will err on the side of removing more and simplifying more, keeping my average person audience member in mind. They also all found the Shorthand presentation to be aesthetically pleasing, which was great to hear.

My presentation also sparked a really good discussion with some of my interviewees - they were interested in digging into the issue of credit scores and wanted to discuss solutions and the current state in more detail. Some great ideas were raised that gave me ideas about where to take future presentations (as it would be too much detail for the purposes of this presentation). I took this as a very good sign - it answered the question I raised in goal #1, whether the flow works and is convincing to the audience. It was convincing, and the audience wanted to take the discussion even further. I also felt that I was able to meet goal #2; my interviewees helped me identify places where I could use less detail, but overall they thought that the level of detail was appropriate.

Based on the feedback I received on my storyboard and wireframes, I am planning on implementing a number of changes to my visualizations and storyboard next week. There are a few categories of changes that I am planning on making:
1. **Removing some content:** I am going to shorten my introduction to streamline it more. I will remove chart #3, but include both pie charts for chart #4. I received conflicting advice about chart #2, so I still need to decide whether to keep it or remove it. My plan is to make the final version of this chart in Flourish or Tableau and then decide if it works in the flow of the story.
2. **Simplifying some content:** I will include just the simpler version of chart #5, and if I choose to include chart #2, I will simplify this as well.
3. **Refine my audience and call to action**: Based on feedback from my interviews, I will refine my audience to not be just the average person, but the average person who might be interested in starting a business. Additionally, this will require a slight change to the call to action - instead of supporting organizations working to change the status quo, I will instead direct them to work directly with these organizations, using them as a resource when starting or expanding their business.

I look forward to implementing these changes next week, finishing my write-up and including my sources, and creating the final versions of the charts for the final version of my presentation.
