# **Final Project**: Credit scores are holding back future small business owners

# Part III for 10/12/21

## Final deliverable link
My final project can be found at this published Shorthand link: <https://carnegiemellon.shorthandstories.com/credit-scores-are-holding-back-future-small-business-owners/index.html>.


## Overview of my process to completing my final project
Part I of my project involved brainstorming a topic, finding data for my visualizations, developing an initial narrative, and determining method and medium. A write-up of Part I can be found [here](/final_project_Paige_Hannah.md).

Part II of my project involved storyboarding, wireframing, and user research. A write-up of Part II can be found [here](/final_project_part_2_Paige_Hannah.md).

Part III involved building out my final project on Shorthand (including building data visualizations and writing content), finalizing the data visualizations and content included, and polishing the Shorthand site before publishing it.


### Part III summary: Getting the project over the finish line
I made a substantial number of changes after finishing Part II of the project. These fell into three categories: refining my audience and call to action, building out the written content on my Shorthand page, and building my data visualizations in Flourish (and Tableau, though none of the Tableau charts made it to the final version of my project). First, I refined my audience and call to action. After taking into account user feedback that I received during Part II, I adjusted my audience to be future small business owners. More specifically, I am speaking to any American citizen who is either a current small business owner or might someday wish to open their own small business. This resulted in an adjustment of my call to action. Instead of my goals being to educate, spread the word, and donate to innovative organizations, my two calls to action are specific to current or future small business owners. The first call to action is for the audience to understand their own credit score and credit history before meeting with small business lenders. The second and related call to action is to determine what type of lender is best for the audience member. If they don't have a credit score or have a low credit score, I provide a list of organizations that they should work with instead of traditional banks (based on their location).

The second change I made to my project involved building out the written content on my Shorthand page. At the end of Part II, I had key topic sentences and main ideas built out in Shorthand, but the bulk of my content was not yet written down. I used the insights from my user research and classroom discussions to make sure I included enough basic information to ensure all audience members would understand the topic. I also narrowed the content I included, and went into less detail in some areas than I had originally planned. I received this feedback from one of the in-class discussions. My group members suggested that I not get into details about the plight of Americans with credit card debt, medical debt, or student loans. Instead, I should mention that these are the issues and assume that my audience is generally aware of these issues. Going into deep dives about these topics did not enhance my narrative, and in fact would distract or confuse my audience (as well as making the write-up longer than it needed to be).

The third change I made to my project involved building my data visualizations in Flourish and embedding them on my Shorthand page. I relied on the skills developed in class and during homework assignments to finalize the types of charts I wanted to make and adjust them to ensure they were as effective as they could be. This involved adjusting the color schemes, increasing font sizes, and using the simplest versions of each of the charts. This is a big insight that I received from my user interviews - while I might find more complicated versions of the charts better because I get excited digging into the numbers, including charts with extra and superfluous information confused and distracted my audience. Instead, especially based on the nature of my topic (financial services), I decided to go with the simplest versions of charts that communicated the data story. For instance, my user feedback indicated that I should remove a chart showing generational credit score divides, because while the content is interesting, it's not directly relevant to my story. I also extrapolated this feedback to other charts throughout my story - for instance, I opted for pie charts instead of unit charts with little pepole icons because I felt it communicated the story more clearly.

Finally, I published my Shorthand page. After submitting this write-up, I will also run my text through TurnItIn to ensure that I used proper citations.
