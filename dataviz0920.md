# Assignment 3 & 4: Critique by Design

## Part 1: Find a visualization
I selected the chart titled "The United States is becoming less White, more multiethnic and multiracial" from a CNN article on the 2020 Census Bureau results. Here is the link to the article: https://www.cnn.com/2021/08/12/politics/us-census-2020-data/index.html

## Part 2: Critique the visualization
This part was already completed and submitted via Google forms

## Part 3: Wireframe a solution
I put together three different versions of the chart: a column chart, an area chart, and a slope chart. I decided that I liked #2, the slope chart, best - this is what I shared primarily during part 4 (the testing phase).
