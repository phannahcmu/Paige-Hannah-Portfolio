# Assignment 3 & 4: Critique by Design

## Part 1: Find a visualization
I selected the chart titled "The United States is becoming less White, more multiethnic and multiracial" from a CNN article on the 2020 Census Bureau results. Here is the link to the article: https://www.cnn.com/2021/08/12/politics/us-census-2020-data/index.html


## Part 2: Critique the visualization
This part was already completed and submitted via Google forms


## Part 3: Wireframe a solution
I put together three different versions of the chart: a column chart, an area chart, and a slope chart. I decided that I liked #2, the area chart, best - this is what I shared primarily during part 4 (the testing phase).

### Wireframe 3: Slope chart

## Part 4: Test the solution
There are 5 questions that I asked two different people:
1. Can you describe what this chart is telling you?
2. Is there anything you find surprising or confusing?
3. Is there anything you would do differently?
4. Who do you think the intended audience is?
5. I then showed them my two alternative wireframes, and asked which version they preferred.
